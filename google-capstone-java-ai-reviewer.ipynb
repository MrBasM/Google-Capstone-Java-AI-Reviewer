It leverages the Gemini AI model to analyze Java source code, identify potential issues, and generate comprehensive review reports.\n","\n","The primary goal is to streamline the code review process, enhance code quality, and provide developers with actionable feedback. This is achieved through the following key steps:\n","\n","1.  **Code Acquisition:** Fetching Java source code files from a specified location.\n","2.  **AI-Powered Review:** Utilizing the Gemini model to analyze the code and generate detailed reviews.\n","3.  **Review Evaluation:** Employing AI to assess the quality and effectiveness of the generated reviews.\n","4.  **Report Generation:** Creating structured Markdown reports summarizing the review findings.\n","\n","This notebook provides a practical implementation of how generative AI can be applied to improve software development workflows, specifically in the context of code review. It includes code examples, explanations, and evaluation metrics to illustrate the process and its benefits.\n","\n","## Alignment with Project Requirements and Real-World Application\n","\n","This notebook directly addresses the core requirements of the Generative AI Capstone project by demonstrating the application of generative AI to a real-world software engineering problem: code review. This project is particularly motivated by the developer's own experience, where frequent Java code reviews consume a significant amount of time and effort. By automating this process, the notebook aims to provide a solution that is both academically relevant and practically beneficial.\n","\n","Here's how it aligns with the key objectives and demonstrates at least three required generative AI capabilities, while also showcasing various prompting techniques:\n","\n","* **Utilization of Generative AI:** The notebook prominently features the use of the Gemini generative AI model to analyze and provide feedback on Java code. This goes beyond simple code analysis tools by leveraging AI to understand the code's context and generate human-like review comments.\n","* **Improvement of Software Development Workflows:** The automated code review process implemented in the notebook significantly streamlines the traditional manual review process. It reduces the time and effort required for code reviews, freeing up developers (including the project creator) to focus on other critical tasks. This directly improves the efficiency of software development workflows in real-world scenarios.\n","* **Focus on a Specific Software Engineering Challenge:** Code review is a crucial but often time-consuming aspect of software development. This notebook tackles this specific challenge by providing an automated solution that enhances the accuracy, consistency, and speed of the review process. This is especially valuable in contexts where developers, like the project creator, spend a substantial portion of their time on code reviews.\n","* **Demonstrated Gen AI Capabilities and Prompting Techniques:**\n","    * **Document understanding (Code Files):** The notebook analyzes and understands Java code *provided as a file*. The AI model interprets the structure, syntax, and semantics of the code within the file to generate review feedback. This demonstrates the model's ability to process and understand code in a file-based context, which is essential for practical code review applications.\n","    * **Prompting Techniques:** The notebook demonstrates a range of prompting techniques:\n","        * **Few-shot prompting:** The `review_summary` function uses few-shot prompting by providing examples of how to summarize code reviews.\n","        * **One-shot prompting:** The `review_score` function uses one-shot prompting by giving one example of how to score the code.\n","        * **Zero-shot prompting:** The `review_file` function uses zero-shot prompting, relying on the model's inherent knowledge to perform the code review without explicit examples.\n","    * **Gen AI evaluation:** The `evaluate_review_by_llm` function demonstrates Gen AI evaluation. The AI model itself assesses the quality of its generated code reviews, providing scores and explanations for various criteria. This helps ensure the reliability and usefulness of the automated review process.\n","    * **Structured output / JSON mode / controlled generation:**  \n","  This project makes use of Gemini‚Äôs native JSON generation mode by setting `response_mime_type = \"application/json\"`. This allows for fully structured, machine-readable output that can be safely parsed and integrated into other tools or systems. It ensures consistency and reduces the need for post-processing or fragile text parsing.\n","* **Evaluation and Metrics:** The notebook includes an evaluation mechanism where the AI model itself assesses the quality of its code reviews. This demonstrates a focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the AI-driven solution, which is essential for any AI project. Metrics such as relevance score, correctness score, etc., are used to quantify the evaluation.\n","* **Practical Implementation:** The notebook provides a complete and practical implementation of the proposed solution. It includes code for fetching files, interacting with the AI model, generating reports, and evaluating the reviews. This demonstrates the feasibility and real-world applicability of the approach.\n","\n","In summary, this notebook effectively leverages generative AI to address a key software engineering challenge, providing a practical and evaluated solution that aligns with the core goals of the Generative AI Capstone project. It demonstrates multiple required Gen AI capabilities, showcases various prompting techniques, and offers a pathway for further enhancement, directly addressing the time-consuming nature of code reviews faced by developers in their daily work.\n","\n","## üîß Setup  \n","Install Gemini SDK and other required libraries for prompt generation.

Consider adding a more informative handling of invalid input.\n","\n","**Performance and Security Considerations:**\n","\n","*   The class itself doesn't have any immediate performance or security concerns. The operations are simple and don't involve external resources or sensitive data handling.\n","*   **11-13:** String concatenation in the `greet()` method can be slightly inefficient for more complex strings. Consider using `StringBuilder` for better performance if the string construction becomes more involved.\n","\n","**Potential Bugs or Edge Cases:**\n","\n","*   **23-27:** The `setAge()` method only checks if the age is positive. Consider adding an upper bound for the age (e.g., `age < 150`) to prevent unrealistic values. If the age is not valid, consider throwing an exception or logging an error message instead of silently ignoring the invalid value.\n","*   The `name` attribute is not validated. It could be `null` or empty. Consider adding validation in the constructor and the `setName()` method.\n","\n","```java\n","public class User {\n","    private String name;\n","    private int age;\n","\n","    public User(String name, int age) {\n","        setName(name);\n","        setAge(age);\n","    }\n","\n","    public void greet() {\n","        System.out.println(\"Hello, my name is \" + name + \" and I'm \" + age + \" years old.\");\n","    }\n","\n","    public String getName() {\n","        return name;\n","    }\n","\n","    public void setName(String name) {\n","        if (name == null || name.trim().isEmpty()) {\n","            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Name cannot be null or empty.\");\n","        }\n","        this.name = name.trim();\n","    }\n","\n","    public int getAge() {\n","        return age;\n","    }\n","\n","    public void setAge(int age) {\n","        if (age <= 0 || age > 150) {\n","            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Age must be between 1 and 150.\");\n","        }\n","        this.age = age;\n","    }\n","}\n","```\n","\n","**Summary of changes in optimized code:**\n","\n","*   Added validation for `name` in `setName()` to ensure it's not null or empty.
